# survey_predicted
Run a Rubin survey simulation, then also generate a 15 dat forecast of potential observations for each night


Started with the survey from https://github.com/lsst-sims/sims_featureScheduler_runs2.2/tree/main/baseline/baseline.py

Warning! Survey simulation results are not cross-platform repeatable. So all steps should be run on the same hardware.

Converting to use the march_start simulation as the base for this.

Converting again to use baseline3.0, aka draft2_rw0.9_uz.py


Converting to baseline3.3, start date 60796
